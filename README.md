# CarCar

Team:

* Person 1 - Which microservice? - Colin Summers (Sales microservice)
* Person 2 - Which microservice? - Kathy Gomez (Auto services)

## Getting Started

**Make sure you have Docker and Git**

1. Fork this repository

2. Clone the forked repository onto your local computer:
git clone https://gitlab.com/Megalanuth/project-beta.git

3. Build and run the project using Docker with these commands:
```
docker volume create beta-data
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
- After running the commands, make sure all Docker containers are running

- These commands execute scripts to automatically handle updates between React and Windows

- View the project in the browser: http://localhost:3000/

## Navigation with URLs
* The server uses `http://localhost:3000` as the Home Page. When entering that into your browser, you will see a navigation bar. Below is a breakdown of each URL and what feature it links to:

## Design

CarCar is made up of 3 microservices which interact with one another.

- **Inventory**
- **Services**
- **Sales**

* Below is a diagram of the project.
![Img](diagram_image/projectBetaExcalidraw.png)


## Integration

The Service and Sales domains work together with the Inventory domain to make **CarCar** possible.

It starts with the Inventory domain, keeping records of automobiles that are available to buy. The Sales and Service microservices obtain information from the Inventory domain, using a **poller**, which talks to the Inventory domain to keep track of which vehicles are in inventory so that the service and sales team maintain up-to-date information.

### Automobiles:
- The **'vin'** at the end of the detail urls represents the VIN for the specific automobile you want to access. This is not an integer ID. This is a string value so you can use numbers and/or letters.

| Action                       | Method | URL

		"manufacturer": {
			"href": "/api/manufacturers/1/",
			"id": 1,
			"name": "Audi"
		}
	},
    "sold": false
}
```
To get the details of a specific automobile, you can query by its VIN:
example url: http://localhost:8100/api/automobiles/1C3CC5FB2AN120174/
NOTE: The details for an automobile include its model and manufacturer.
Return Value:
```

```
You can update the color, year, and sold status of an automobile (SEND THIS JSON BODY):
```
{
  "color": "red",
  "year": 2012,
  "sold": true
}
```
Getting a list of automobiles returns a dictionary with the key "autos" set to a list of automobile information.:
```
{
  "autos": [
    {
      "href": "/api/automobiles/1C3CC5FB2AN120174/",
      "id": 1,
      "color": "yellow",
      "year": 2013,
      "vin": "1C3CC5FB2AN120174",
      "model": {
        "href": "/api/models/1/",
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Tacoma",
        "picture_url": "image.yourpictureurl.com",
        "manufacturer": {
          "href": "/api/manufacturers/1/",
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Toyota"
        }
      },
      "sold": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Sales microservice

On the backend, the sales microservice has 4 models: AutomobileVO, Customer, SalesPerson, and Sale. The Sale model interacts with the other three models, getting its data from the other three.

The AutomobileVO is a value object that gets data about the automobiles in the inventory using a poller. The sales poller automotically polls the inventory microservice for data, so the sales microservice is constantly getting updated data.

The reason for integration between these two microservices is that when recording a new sale, you'll need to choose which car is being sold and that info is stored within the inventory microservice.

## Service microservice

The backend of the service microservice includes includes 3 models: Technnician, AutomobileVO, and Appointment. The Appoinment model interacts with the Technician model through it's foreign key and the Appointment model interacts with the AutomobileVO model through its vin. A poller was created to automatically poll for inventory microservice data to be created for the services microservice.

The reason for integration between these two microservices is that when an automobile is purchased, the vin is recorded to qualify for VIP services when creating an appointment.
